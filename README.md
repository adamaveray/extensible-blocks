# Extensible Blocks Library

Utilities for building libraries with complex view block extension logic, based on the block extension functionality behind [Symfony Forms](https://symfony.com/doc/current/forms.html) and genericised to be configurable for different applications.

Libraries built with this can allow their consumers to customise rendering specific views directly within template by declaring blocks following specific patterns. See [the Symfony Forms theming documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/form_themes.html) for details on the concepts behind this library, and [the examples](./examples) for usage information.
